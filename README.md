# TEX – Time Expiry eXplorer

TEX (Time Expiry eXplorer) is a simple online calculator to help individuals calculate their sentence timelines under Tennessee law.

## How it Works
- Enter your imposed date, pretrial jail credits, sentence length (in years), release percentage, and sentence reduction credits (SRCs).
- TEX will calculate:
  - **SED** – Sentence Effective Date
  - **FEXP** – Full Expiration Date
  - **EXP** – Expiration Date (after credits applied)
  - **RED** – Release Eligibility Date (with proportional credits applied)

## Live Demo
Once GitHub Pages is enabled, TEX will be available here:

## Usage
Open the calculator in your browser, enter the required fields, and click **Calculate**.
